# My notes to controlsd 
## Where to start

### Source
From:  
  managed_processes[] = {  
   ...  
   "controlsd": "selfdrive.controls.controlsd",  
   ...  
  }  
  selfdrive.controls.controlsd will be import at manager.py::prepare_managed_process()  
  ===> controlsd.py can be found under openpilot/selfdrive/controls/  
    [note] defaultd is used to send can messages when controlsd is off to make car test easier

### special libraries:
    a) pyzmq: This is the Python bindings for ZMQ.
    b) pycapnp: This is a python wrapping of the C++ implementation of the Capâ€™n Proto library.
       Capâ€™n Proto is an insanely fast data interchange format and capability-based RPC system.
